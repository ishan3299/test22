## Types of VA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Network Based Scans: used to identify possible network attacks. detect vulnerable systems on wired or wireless networks.
 
  -- Tasks: Security control check
            identifying, quantifying, and priotiazing network threats
            Router/WiFi passwords analysis
            Review Network strength and attacks: 
              DDOS
              MITM
              Network intrusion
              Device-Level security analysis

## Information gathering
 - Active and Passive scan
  -- Google dork: Passive scan

## Banner Grabbing:
 - Banner grabbing is the act of getting software banner information, whether its done manually, or by using any OSINT tool.
 - And its termed as software fingerprinting also.

## Why Banner Grabbing:
 - Banner grabbing allows an attacker to discover network hosts and running services with their versions ont the open ports.
 - There are 2 types of banner grabbing
 
  - Active Banner Grabbing:
   - most popular type of banner grabbing, basically the act of sending packets to remote host and waiting for thier response to analyze data.
   
  - Passive Banner Grabbing:
   - enables you to get same information while avoiding a high level of exposure from the origin connection.
   
 ## SEC_TERMS:
  - Exploit: is a tool that is used to manipulate the vulnerability.
  - Payload: is a custom code that attacker want the system to execute and that is to be selected and delivered by the Framework.
  - Shellcode: basically a list of carefully crafted commands that can be executed once the code is injected into a running application.
